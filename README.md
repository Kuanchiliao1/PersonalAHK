# hello.ahk

Thank you for checking out my personal AutoHotkey script! This is a collection of mini scripts I've collected over the years.(I didn't figure out Github until this year) It automates a variety of repetitive tasks and actions to save time and effort on the my end

## Here's a demo of some of my most useful scripts:
- Hotkeys for minimizing/opening programs
- Automate the expansion of frequently used emails or phrases or code
- Include a timer GUI that can be easily set up in a matter of seconds
- Converting rem => px and px => rem for Frontend work
- Instantly googling the highlighted text
- Using OpenAI's API to summarize, give terminology, or generate flashcards for highlighted text. I think this is by far the most technically complex script on here. It's still a work in progress and I might make a separate repo just for this script in the future.

## Video demo of the above examples:

Feel free to steal any examples that you like and use them as inspiration for your own projects. This script was intended purely for personal use, please note that the full script may not work on all devices.
