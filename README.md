Hi! 
This is my autohotkey script intended for personal use, so it may not work on your device.

The main goals are to automated any redundant tasks/actions. 
Examples:
- little things such as a hotkey for closing/minimizing windows(alternative is moving your mouse to click the x button)
- replacing the unergonomic ESC key with Capslock + Q
- autoexpand for my emails so I don't have to type out the whole thing
- a timer I can set up in less than 5 actions


I hope to give potential inspiration to others who are looking for snippets they can use.
